# SilsoePondMonitoring
This project is aiming to monitor the effect rainfall has on the level of water in a pond in Silsoe, Bedfordshire. There are three distinct software components to the project:

1. **Pond Monitoring** - The monitoring service will pull rainfall data from the Met Office API once a day. It will pull all available values in CSV format and store them locally on disk using a docker volume. 

2. **Pond Display** - The display service will create graphical representations of the rainfall and pond level data and display them using Nginx.

3. **Pond Total** - This project simple takes the daily values generated by the pond monitoring service and calculates a daily total and then stores it in a CSV.

The project is currently running on a Raspberry PI.
